# Caminar

### The Caminar website I designed and the aim of it is to be a gallery of illustrated works, and it consists of one page, in which it displays the creations of the owner of the site. I designed it using HTML5, CSS3, font awesome, media query . The purpose of designing the site was the actual application of what you had learned in a realistic way, and you will find the link at the bottom, and I thank you for reading until the end.
